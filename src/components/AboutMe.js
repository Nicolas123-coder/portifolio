            Hey there ! I am Nicolas. I have been developing since 2020, both front-end and back-end applications. The technologies that I mostly use are Node Js and Python for APIâ€™s development, such as their common used libraries. About the Front-end technologies that I use, Bootstrap, React, HTML and CSS are my most used. Such as the development itself, I have experiences with cloud provisioning, most familiarized with AWS services (S3, ECS, Lambda), and the indispensables practices with different structs of Databases as well, MongoDB and PostgresSql, for example.
